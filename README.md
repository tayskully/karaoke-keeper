## Karaoke Keeper is your one stop shop for your go-to karaoke songs!

Our motivation for creating Karaoke Keeper was our own experiences as avid karaoke goers. There was a need for a platform to keep and track all ones Go-To songs, especially when out on the town, and feeling overwhelmed by the endless selection of song options available.

Our Karaoke keeper allows users to search for their favorite songs, view the lyrics, and add songs to their karaoke profile. Future development will include categorization of songs for particular themed nights, and the ability to add comments to songs, in order to note how they went or parts you still need to practice.
